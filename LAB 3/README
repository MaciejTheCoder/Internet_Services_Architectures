# Internet_Services_Architectures
Spring projects from Internet Services Architectures course from the University.

During third laboratory I got familiar with basic concepts of decomposition monolithic application into stand-alone modules based on 
microservices architecture. In my case I created 3 of them: movies, directors and gateway. Project is really similar to that one from the
previos laboratory.

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
  Open JDK 11.x+
  Apache Maven 3.5.x+
